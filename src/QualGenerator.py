@package    QualGenerator
@brief  **Generate list of quality PHRED quality values mimicking illumina quality score.**
Briefly, the program contains 5 predefined templates very good, good, medium, bad and very 
bad quality at 5 distributed positions. According to the lenght of reads to generate, a object
specific pattern will be calculated at class instantiation. From these templates,
"random guided" quality quality strings can be generated. It will follow the object pattern
thanks to a coefficient of attraction towards the pattern mean but with a part of randomness
thank a gaussian distribution according to pattern standard deviation.
