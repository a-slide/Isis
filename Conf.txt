### RELATIVE QUANTITY OF READS ###

# Overall quantity of reads
read_num	100000

### Relative frequencies of DNA source in fastq (sum of frequencies should be equal to 1)

#Â Host genome frequency
hg_freq	0.45
# Virus genome frequency
vg_freq	0.45
# True junctions frequency
tj_freq	0.09
# False junctions frequency
fj_freq	0.01

# Mean number of sampling in true junctions
ntj_freq	100
# Number of sampling in false junctions
nfj_freq	1

## Allow or forbid sampling in specific DNA regions
# repeat regions (lowercase characters in fasta sequences)
allow_repeats	False
# Ambigous DNA region (extensive IUPAC code)
allow_ambigous	False
# Duplicated reads. If true duplicates will be postfixed with an unique id number
allow_duplicate	False

# Read length
read_len	150

# Sequencing mode. If single end set "se" else if paired ends set "pe"
seq_mod	pe

## Options to set up if paired end mode
# Maximal Minimal and mean sonication size max > mean > min
max_sonic	1000
min_sonic	150
mean_sonic	500
# Parameter used for shapping the beta distribution of somication size.
# Lower value = larger width of sonication peak (5 to 10), Higher value = thiner peak (10 to 20). Need to be higher than 2
certainty	10


## Quality score options
# Quality score scale = solexa (CASAVA < 1.3), illumina (CASAVA 1.3 to 1.7), sanger (which is CASAVA >= 1.8)
